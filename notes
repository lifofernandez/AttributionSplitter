hre.network.config.url works for you?
This only works for JSON-RPC networks though, it's undefined for the in-memory hardhat network

it's undefined for me, it's the in-memory hardhat network, so basically the in-memory hardhat network doesn't expose endpoints you can make requests to?

Yes, that's correct
If you want a hardhat network with an HTTP endpoint, use npx hardhat node and then connect to it with npx hardhat <task> --network localhost
